# **Act** with compassion.

1. Act with positive intent.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2) Own your actions.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
3) Call out bad acts.

<!--

And acting with compassion starts with what you can control

which is yourself

many people say "assume positive intent" but ironically that actually gives people an out to act _without_ positive intent

so let's focus on what we can do

2 - even with the right intent, impact can be negative. Own your actions when things go wrong.


3 - call out bad acts, and on the other side, reward good acts

acts, not actors, because they don't know they're doing something bad

-->

![bg opacity:80%](images/full-carrots.jpg)

<!--

I said this is a talk about culture, and I want to share my favorite analogy

of culture as a community garden.

When you find a good culture, it's like walking into a community garden that produces the best fruits and vegetables.

The carrots taste delicious, and you don't want to leave.

But the carrots don't grow themselves. The people in the community cultivate them.

When weeds start to take over, someone needs to pull them.

You can rely on someone else to do it, and still enjoy the carrots,

but you can also contribute.


Calling out bad acts in pull request interactions is a small but important contribution to the weeding of the carrots. It's critical to keeping the garden healthy.

## If you aren't **aware** of a power dynamic, you're probably on the **strong** side of it.

<!--
Power dynamics appear in every relationship we have.
You certainly know about them when you're on the weaker side of it.
And when you don't know about a power dynamic in a relationship, there's a good chance it's because you're on the stronger side.

They can be problematic, but we can also navigate them successfully in a team.

Especially if we are aware of them.

-->

<!-- _header: "0 | 1 | **2: Acknowledge power dynamics.** | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 "  -->

![bg opacity:80%](images/aside-talk-down.jpg)

## Power dynamics can be <br/>**multi-directional**.

<!--
and those multiple directions can conflict

For example,

I interact with my boss in my PRs every day.
She's my boss - that's one power dynamic, in which I am on the weaker side.

On the other hand, she looks to me for many technical details and decisions.

That's a power dynamic in the opposite direction, and it also appears in the interactions we have in a PR.
-->

![bg opacity:80%](images/aside-talk-down.jpg)

1. Choose words with care & **intention**.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2) Be **explicit** instead of implicit.

<!--

The best way to navigate power dynamics is to be careful with words and choose them intentionally

The weight of our words, especially when we're on the strong side of the dynamic, is incredible.

Choose them carefully.

...

And to avoid misinterpretation of words in a power dynamic

be explicit instead of implicit.

When something isn't that important, SAY SO.

When it is important, SAY SO.

Don't leave it up to the reader to interpret.

Feedback from the strong side takes on a very heavy weight.
That weight can easily elevate something that doesn't matter to something that is perceived to matter very much.

<!-- _class: invert -->

# 4. Remove ambiguity.

---

<!-- _header: "0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **4: Remove ambiguity.** | 5 | 6 "  -->

# **Ask** clarifying questions.

<!--

Back to our previous section about asking instead of guessing

If something is unclear, get more information.

Asking questions is most direct way to remove ambiguity.

But here's the thing...

-->

---

<!-- _header: "0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **4: Remove ambiguity.** | 5 | 6 "  -->

# **Clarifying questions** are in direct conflict with **asynchronous collaboration**.

<!--
Collaborating through PRs is *inherently asynchronous*, and with that comes some *really great* things.
We can *collaborate across time and location*.
People can *respond when it's the right time* for them, because *right now might not be the best time.
So everyone can *take their time before responding*.

And that means we get their

- best focus
- best ideas
- best self

(pause)

But there is *slowness* to asynchronous communication. That can be really *frustrating*.

And that slowness is exacerbated by every round trip

Every time someone needs to ask another clarifying question

That's potentially another day before we resolve this conversation

-->

---

<!-- _header: "0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **4: Remove ambiguity.** | 5 | 6 "  -->

![bg](images/full-text-convo.jpg)

<!--

I have conversations like this with my 12yo over text message

where we say nothing for 10 messages back and forth

until finally she gets to her point

You can't have conversations like that between US and Europe, where any message might not be answered until the next day

So to collaborate asynchronously, we need to remove ambiguity as quickly as possible.

(answer: the sleepover, cousin muffin has skipped a nap and is unhinged)

<!-- _header: "0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **4: Remove ambiguity.** | 5 | 6 "  -->

# **Communicate** effectively.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1) Clearly
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2) Completely
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
3) Concisely
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
4) Bidirectionally

<!--


And we need to remove that ambiguity as proactively as possible.

by communicating effectively

...


this is probably a non-controversial statement
and also very nebulous
we're all trying to do this in a lot of ways
here are some things to focus on.

-->

---

<!-- _header: "0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **4: Remove ambiguity.** | 5 | 6 "  -->

# State the unstated.

<!--

Assumptions, context, conclusions...all of these things can easily be misinterpreted. State them explicitly.

-->

---

<!-- _header: "0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **4: Remove ambiguity.** | 5 | 6 "  -->

# Be **direct**.

<!--

Compassionately, obviously,

but say what you want to say. An example:

a few years ago I started doing this thing where I wanted to be extra friendly and considerate in my PR reviews

-->

---

<!-- _header: "0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **4: Remove ambiguity.** _Be direct._ | 5 | 6 "  -->

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> "**What do you think** about doing X instead of Y?" ❌

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> "I think **we should do** X instead of Y, because Z." ✅

<!--

So no matter how important I thought a change was, I'd phrase comments like the top

Extremely passively and indirect

But what I really meant was the bottom - I think we should make this change.

The top can be fine if you really don't have an opinion,

just make sure you're saying what you mean.

-->

---

# Give **direction**.

---

## Communicate **expectations**.

frustratingly, this kind of documentation exists solely to point people to
after they've proven that they didn't read it
but it's still important to have something to point to
-->

## Provide **clear** and **direct** templates.

![width:900 github pr template](images/aside-pr-template.png)

<!--

define issue and PR templates in your repo

- Suggest a format to enforce consistency of PRs, which can reduce cognitive load

## Explicitly **assign responsibilities**.

* Assignee; reviewers.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
* Establish a **working agreement** to remove ambiguity.
  - Who merges?
  - What is a reviewer's responsibility?

<!--

1 - assign the PR to someone, and add reviewers...

2 - whether documented or enforced by convention or automation

-->

---

<!-- _header: "0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **4: Remove ambiguity.** _Give direction._ | 5 | 6 "  -->

## Use the **suggestion** feature.

![width:900](images/aside-suggesting.png)

<!--
during reviews

Allows a person to commit the prescribed changes directly in the GitHub UI.

Especially nice for very small changes.

Becomes more difficult to manage when there are synchronized suggestions in multiple places,
like changing a variable name.

-->

---

<!-- _header: "0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **4: Remove ambiguity.** _Give direction._ | 5 | 6 "  -->

## State **the importance** of addressing the feedback.

<!--

the perceived importance is usually just tied to where you are in the power dynamic

- this slide is the reason I started writing this talk - my first ever opinion on PRs & PR reviews

- Is this feedback blocking or non-blocking?
- are you expecting them to address this in this PR? another?
- these are all things I want to know about your feedback so that I can respond correctly

# Radiate **intent**

<!--

As giving direction relates to how we expect others to act,

just as important is radiating intent on how _we_ plan to act.


ambiguity and uncertainty are what lead to those round trips

which we know take a long time to resolve when working asynchronously.

when we radiate intent on what we plan to do,

we can snuff those out

...

some specific things we can do in our PRs to radiate intent...

## Do not merge/Prototype.

![width:900 prototype PR in github](images/aside-do-not-merge.png)

<!--

let them know this isn't to be merged ever

there's a tendency to think every PR must be merged

but opening a PR that proves out an idea is sometimes the best way to get good feedback

because everyone can see the code, and pull it down to run it

but when it's served its purpose, you can close it and re-implement with more production-worthy changes

> _I'm here (to request changes) <br/> **for the right reasons**_.

<!--

one aspect of pull requests that I think fully captures the problem of ambiguity

and benefits tremendously from all the strategies we've talked about to remove ambiguity

is the question of which changes should I be requesting in a PR review

has anyone collaborated on a project where PR review feedback was imbalanced

like one person wanted everyone else's code to look like they wrote it

and others on the team were more like "ehhh I can understand it, it's good"?

That's ambiguity at work.

-->

---

<!-- _header: "0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **4: Remove ambiguity.** | 5 | 6 "  -->

![bg opacity:80%](images/aside-bachelor.jpg)

## Are these **The Right Reasons**?

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1) The code could be more readable.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2) Code that was refactored but<br/> not logically changed looks incorrect.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
3) The syntax doesn't match my preference.

<!--

identifying whether a particular change is fair to request is hard, because the answer is often "it depends"

1 - what's readable?

if you're a functional programmer and I have a Java background and we're both writing javascript,

we're going to have very different perspectives on which code is more readable

2 - how wrong is wrong?

is it a variable name that doesn't make sense anymore?

is it costing us money?

where do we stand on the question of whether that fix should live in this PR or in a separate one?

3 -

what kind of ownership does the project have?

Is it a single owner/DRI/dictator?

Is there no one owner but maintained by 5 different people?

# **Intentionally define** <br/>The Right Reasons.

<!--

All this to say

Ambiguity leads to imbalances,

and honestly inequities.

It leads to people falling back on power dynamics to decide whether to request specific changes.

That leads to different collaborators being held to different standards.

That's usually not what you want.

The best way to kill ambiguity is to define rules of engagement more precisely

# Be **concise** and **cohesive**.

<!--

a good story is concise -- it doesn't drown you with superfluous info

it's also cohesive -- the words that are there work together instead of against each other.

In a pull request, we can easily fall into the trap of including everything you did since your previous one

even if it's not directly related to the work we're doing

And to avoid this, we want to make sure we break our work up into right-sized pieces

Too big, or too sprawling, and they can be too difficult for a person to review,
and they'll rubberstamp LGTM,
and two weeks later we discover the bug we snuck into that big rubberstamped PR.

## Break up changes that require <br/>a **different mindset** to review.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1) By architectural layer.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2) By infrastructural vs implementation.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
3) By risky vs routine.

<!--

Sometimes it's obvious how to break up a PR that isn't concise or cohesive

But often it's not

my guiding light for separating the tricky ones is to break them up by mindset required to review them

when a PR contains different types of work that require different mindets to review, it's more likely to draw the LGTM response,
which translates to "there were too many things going on and I didn't totally get it all, but I inherently trust you."

1 - api vs front-end, etc
2 - infra invites more thorough review of concepts;
  - implementation is more "are you following the existing patterns."
  - includes the "walking skeleton" approach, where you start with a PR that just puts the infrastructure in place so that different parts _can_ function together...then implementing each of the functions into the skeleton.
3 - routine work that follows existing patterns usually gets "hey you missed this" type of feedback; novel work that takes thoughtful consideration of approaches invites more theoretical feedback.

Ideally you can do this with separate PRs.
If you can't, at the very least practice good commit hygiene to separate your work....which leads me....

Commit hygiene

## Make commits **atomic**.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1) Small.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2) Clear and concise message.

You can amend them along the way to meet these criteria

<!--

and when you do this, the commits _can_ tell a story

and I agree that 95% of the time that doesn't matter, because we're just looking at the diff view of the PR anyway

But sometimes it is easier to review a PR one commit at a time - especially refactoring PRs

and It's nice to provide people that option

(read for the back of room)

# Show **progress**.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1) Draft/Work In Progress (WIP) PRs.

2) Prototypes.

3) Walking Skeletons.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
4) Requests For Comments (RFCs).

<!--

waiting until the very end for feedback results in more re-work

than collecting feedback along the way.

1 - use the draft feature if you remember it exists 😅 just make sure it's clearly marked as experimental/incomplete.

  - we'll talk more about this in a bit

2 - build prototypes that reviewers can play with by checking out the PR's branch

3 - build the infrastructure for a feature, and let people review that before you fill in the guts.

4 - these are technically better served as issues, but opening them can help you create a more successful PR.

...

I give you this advice knowing full well that it is my own biggest struggle

# Perfect is <br/>the **enemy of done**.

<!--

I think the actual quote is "enemy of good" but it makes more sense to me as enemy of done.

Again, this is as much a reminder to myself as it is to you,

...

When it comes to PRs, perfection might be getting in the way of shipping things.

and it leads to opening PRs only after the work is all done

which leads to more re-work, due to waiting too long for feedback

# 6. Grow together.

<!--

Seems kind of silly, given we're talking about collaboration

But I think sometimes people forget

just a couple small tips here

# Give **credit**.

![github commit summary, showing multiple contributors](images/aside-all-contribs.jpg)

<!--

give credit where credit is due

This is especially important when more experienced pair with less experienced

If you work together on something, add both contributors to the commits.

Give everyone credit so you're all building your portfolio of work.

maybe it's something you learned about the programming language

2 - how did I do this thing that you might also need to do?

what cool dev tool features did I learn about while testing this?
